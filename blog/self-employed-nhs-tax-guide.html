                    <p><strong>If you're genuinely self-employed</strong> (not via an umbrella company), you have far greater scope to reduce your tax bill through legitimate expense claims.</p>

                    <div class="info-box warning">
                        <h4>⚠️ IR35 Warning</h4>
                        <p>Since April 2021, NHS Trusts and agencies determine your IR35 status. If they class you as "inside IR35," tax is deducted at source like an employee, but you can still claim expenses via Self-Assessment. If you're "outside IR35" or work through your own limited company, you have more flexibility — but also more responsibility.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Why Many NHS Staff Overpay Tax</h2>
                    
                    <p>We regularly see self-employed NHS staff who've been paying too much tax for years. The most common reasons:</p>
                    
                    <h3>1. Not Registered for Self-Assessment</h3>
                    <p>Some locums and agency workers don't realise they need to file a tax return. They assume tax deducted at source covers everything — but without Self-Assessment, you <strong>cannot claim expenses</strong> that would reduce your bill.</p>
                    
                    <h3>2. Missing Allowable Expenses</h3>
                    <p>Even those who do file often miss legitimate deductions: professional body fees, travel costs, equipment, training courses, and more. Each missed expense means paying tax you don't owe.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3. Wrong Tax Code</h3>
                    <p>If you've moved between employed and self-employed work, HMRC may have applied the wrong tax code, resulting in over-deduction. This is especially common for those doing bank shifts alongside locum work.</p>
                    
                    <h3>4. Emergency Tax</h3>
                    <p>New locums or those starting with a new agency often have emergency tax applied (usually code 1257L M1 or W1). This ignores your personal allowance history and typically results in overpayment.</p>
                    
                    <h3>5. No Previous Returns</h3>
                    <p>If you've never filed a return, you may be owed refunds going back <strong>4 years</strong>. We can help you submit retrospective returns to recover overpaid tax.</p>

                    <h2>Allowable Expenses for Self-Employed NHS Staff</h2>
                    
                    <p>Here's what you can legitimately claim to reduce your taxable income:</p>

                        <p>You can claim travel to any workplace where you expect to work for less than 24 months. Most locum and agency placements qualify.

                        <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Fiona works as a locum GP across 4 practices in the Greater Glasgow area. She earns £90,000/year and hadn't been claiming expenses properly.</p>

                    <h2>How to Claim a Tax Refund</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Step 1: Gather Your Records</h3>
                    <p>Collect receipts, bank statements, and invoices for all work-related expenses. For previous years, request statements from professional bodies and check your bank history.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Step 2: Register for Self-Assessment</h3>
                    <p>If you're not already registered, sign up on the HMRC website. You'll receive a Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) within 10 working days.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Step 3: File Your Return</h3>
                    <p>Submit your Self-Assessment return including all allowable expenses. For previous years, you can amend returns within 12 months of the original deadline, or submit "overpayment relief claims" for earlier years.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Step 4: Wait for Your Refund</h3>
                    <p>HMRC typically processes refunds within 4-12 weeks. You can choose to receive it as a bank transfer or cheque, or have it offset against future tax bills.</p>

                        <p>At LimeTree Accounting, we specialise in helping self-employed NHS staff claim every penny they're entitled to. We'll review your situation, identify missed expenses, prepare your returns, and handle HMRC correspondence — so you can focus on patient care.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Special Considerations by Role</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Locum Doctors</h3>
                    <p>Locum GPs and hospital doctors often have the highest potential refunds due to expensive indemnity insurance (£3,000-£10,000+ for certain specialties). Many also work through limited companies — we can advise on the most tax-efficient structure.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Agency Nurses</h3>
                    <p>Check whether you're paid via an umbrella company (employed) or directly (self-employed). If through an umbrella, you're employed — but may still be able to claim flat-rate expense allowances through HMRC's P87 form.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Healthcare Assistants & Support Workers</h3>
                    <p>If you work for multiple care agencies and are genuinely self-employed, you can claim travel between sites, uniform costs, and training expenses. The amounts may be smaller, but they still add up.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Allied Health Professionals</h3>
                    <p>Physiotherapists, occupational therapists, radiographers, and other AHPs working self-employed can claim HCPC registration, professional body fees, specialist equipment, and CPD.</p>
                    
                    <h3>NHS Bank Staff</h3>
                    <p>Bank staff are usually employed (not self-employed), so different rules apply. However, you can still claim uniform maintenance allowance and certain professional subscriptions through HMRC's P87 form or your tax return if you complete Self-Assessment for other reasons.</p>

                    <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Claiming home-to-work travel:</strong> Only claimable if your base is home and you travel to temporary workplaces</li>
                        <li><strong>Overclaiming mileage:</strong> Keep a mileage log — HMRC can challenge vague estimates</li>
                        <li><strong>Mixing personal and business:</strong> Only claim the business proportion of mixed-use items</li>
                        <li><strong>Missing the deadline:</strong> Self-Assessment deadline is 31st January; late filing incurs penalties</li>
                        <li><strong>Not keeping receipts:</strong> Digital photos/scans are fine, but keep records for 5 years</li>
                    </ul>

                            <h3>Can self-employed NHS staff claim a tax refund?</h3>
                            <p>Yes. Many self-employed NHS workers overpay tax, especially in their first year or when working through agencies. If you haven't claimed all allowable expenses, you may be entitled to a refund by submitting a Self-Assessment tax return or amending previous returns going back 4 years.</p>

                            <p>If you're truly self-employed (not employed via an umbrella company), yes. You must register for Self-Assessment and file a tax return by 31st January following the end of the tax year. Even if tax is deducted at source, Self-Assessment lets you claim expenses to reduce your tax bill.</p>

                            <p>Yes. If you purchase your own scrubs, uniforms, or specialist clothing required for work, you can claim the full cost. You can also claim a flat-rate laundry allowance (£60-£140 per year depending on frequency) for washing uniforms at home.</p>
                        </div>

                            <p>You can claim tax refunds for the previous 4 tax years. For example, in the 2025/26 tax year, you can still claim refunds for 2021/22, 2022/23, 2023/24, and 2024/25. This can result in substantial refunds if you haven't been claiming expenses.</p>
